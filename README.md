## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Collect and explore global COVID-19 data from **Our World in Data**
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on trends like:
  - Daily and cumulative cases
  - Deaths and death rates
  - Vaccination progress
- Visualize key insights using line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps
- Calculate and compare metrics such as **death rate** and **vaccination coverage**
- (Optional) Build an interactive dashboard with **Streamlit** for dynamic exploration
